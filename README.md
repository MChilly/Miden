# Petrol stations app with Google Maps
## This is my very first attempt at creating a full-stack application.

### Petrol Stations is a web application helping individuals find the geolocation of different  petrol stations near them and check prices. 

#### Technologies used in this APP:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS & Bootsrap, Javascript, and "ejs" engine template.
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL database.
- Authendication and Authorization implemented with Passport-Local. Bcryptjs is used for encryption.

#### To Run the application:

- install nodejs and npm
- npm install
- npm install -g nodemon
- To run locally: >nodemon server.js
- Run without nodemon: >node server.js

## ***WARNING:***
##### Import a: "google api key=YOUR_API_KEY" - for the map in views -> index.ejs -> line 272
